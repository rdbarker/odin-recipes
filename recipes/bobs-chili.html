    <h1>Bob's Little Known, Less Cared About Chili</h1>
    <img src="../images/bobs-chili.jpeg" alt="Bob's delicious chili">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Savory, smoky, easy-to-make chili. Sometimes I add a can of corn, too. Maybe have some sweet corn bread muffins with honey on the side. You could use black beans, pinto beans, pink beans, or small red beans in place of the kidney beans.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound thick-cut bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3(15.5 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce or to taste(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon and onion together in a large pot over medium heat until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, garlic and cumin to the pot; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir kidney beans, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, and hot pepper sauce into the beef mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until thick, about 1 hour. Skim excess grease if desired.</li>
    </ol>
