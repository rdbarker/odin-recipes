    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chili is slightly sweet with a touch of heat; the wine gives it a different taste. Everyone in my family loves this chili. I've won a couple of work chili cook-offs with this recipe and done well in some larger cook-offs as well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 pounds hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li> 2 pounds ground sirloin </li>
        <li> 1 large onion, chopped </li>
        <li> 1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li> 8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> 2 jalapeno peppers, finely chopped</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li> 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 2 bay leaves</li>
        <li> 2 cups Merlot or other dry red wine</li>
        <li> 2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes, undrained and chopped</li>
        <li> 2 (15 ounce) cans dark red kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li> 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in Italian sausage and ground sirloin. Cook and stir until meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to a large Dutch oven; place over medium-high heat. Stir in chopped onion; add red, yellow, and green bell peppers, garlic, and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, tomato paste, oregano, salt, black pepper, and bay leaves. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Stirring constantly, pour in wine, chopped tomatoes and their juice, kidney beans, tomato sauce, and chopped chipotle chiles in sauce. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Uncover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaves before serving.</li>
    </ol>
